<ptitle>switch statement</ptitle>
　The switch statement lets you write if, else if, and else concisely. It has the following syntax:<r/>
<bq>
switch(base_expression)<r/>
{<r/>
<kw>case</kw> condition_expression1 :<r/>
<r/>
case condition_expression2 :<r/>
<r/>
:<r/>
:<r/>
<r/>
<kw>default</kw>:<r/>
<r/>
:<r/>
:<r/>
}<r/>
</bq>
<r/>
　The base_expression contains an expression, which is evaluated first. Write an expression in condition_expression? next to the case in the block following the switch.<r/>
　condition_expression? is evaluated one after another in the block. If the evaluated result is the same as base_expression, execution starts from there. If the condition_expression? does not match, any statements or statements between them are ignored. If they match, case and default are ignored thereafter.<r/>
　default: can be omitted, but if default is specified, the statements and statements following default are forcibly executed.<r/>
　Write <kw>break</kw>; to get out of the block. Note that it is common to forget to write a break and execute up to the contents of the next case.<r/>
<r/>
<example>
	switch(a)<r/>
	{<r/>
	case 0:<r/>
		inform("a is 0");<r/>
		break;<r/>
	case 1:<r/>
		inform("b is 1");<r/>
		break;<r/>
	case 2:<r/>
		inform("b is 2");<r/>
		break;<r/>
	default:<r/>
		inform("b is not 0, 1 or 2");<r/>
	}<r/>
<r/>
<r/>
	switch(a)<r/>
	{<r/>
	case 0:<r/>
	case 1: // There is no break, so pass here in case 0<r/>
		inform("a is 0 or 1");<r/>
		break;<r/>
	case 2:<r/>
		inform("a is 2");<r/>
	} // Since there is no default, nothing is executed except for 0 1 2<r/>
<r/>
<r/>
	switch(a)<r/>
	{<r/>
	case b+1: // An expression can be specified after the case<r/>
		inform("a==b+1");<r/>
		break;<r/>
	case c+b:<r/>
		inform("a==c+b");<r/>
	}<r/>
<r/>
	switch(str)<r/>
	{<r/>
	case "AEIOU": // Strings can also be specified<r/>
		type=1;<r/>
		break;<r/>
	case "ABCDE":<r/>
		type=2;<r/>
		break;<r/>
	}<r/>
